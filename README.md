The chanllege:
A mailing meters company has high scale shipping enterprises who do business with them. 
They often observe irregular shipping throughput for a lot of their enterprise clients and it often helps them to forecast quarterly/half yearly forecasts for these clients in order to better understand their needs.
To better understand their clients needs we need to understand their clients seasonalities, client segments and their throughput behaviour.

Goal:
1) Use the sample data to predict the next 6 months data.
2) Use the sample data to analysis business insight.
